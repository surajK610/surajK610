### Hi there 👋, I'm Suraj

I am a 2024 graduate of [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) with an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science. I am interested in (1) solving complex engineering problems and (2) exploring fascinating mathematic/scientific ideas. My goal is to build algorithms that learn how to do useful things and are aligned with human values. I currently work as a Quantitative Researcher at [Point72](https://point72.com/) focused on using NLP research methods to find signal. I previously conducted research in the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) focused on learning dynamics of in context learning, investigating compositionality using causal interventions methods, mechanistic interpretability, and reinforcement learning from human feedback with Dr. Ellie Pavlick. I have previously collaborated with EleutherAI. 

I've also been working on a couple of other ideas that I find interesting. Please check out my [blog](https://surajk610.github.io/) to learn more! 🐊
